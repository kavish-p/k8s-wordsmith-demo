# Kubernetes Wordsmith Demo

Wordsmith is the demo project shown at DockerCon EU 2017 and 2018.

The demo app runs across three containers:

- [db](db/Dockerfile) - a Postgres database which stores words

- [words](words/Dockerfile) - a Java REST API which serves words read from the database

- [web](web/Dockerfile) - a Go web application which calls the API and builds words into sentences:



Once deployed, browse to http://localhost:8080 to see the site. Each time you refresh the page, you'll see a different sentence generated by the API calls.
